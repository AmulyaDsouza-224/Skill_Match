1. Linked List<br>

Used to store volunteer and task records dynamically.<br>
Allows easy insertion, deletion, and traversal without a fixed size.

2. Dynamic Memory Allocation<br>

Used while creating new volunteer or task entries using malloc().<br>
Supports unlimited data storage during runtime.

3. Linear Search<br>

Used to match volunteers with tasks based on skill comparison.<br>
Traverses the linked list to find suitable candidates.

4. String Handling<br>

Used to compare skill keywords (strcmp) and store textual inputs.<br>
Important for checking compatibility between volunteers and task needs.

5. Modular Programming<br>

Each feature (add, view, match) is implemented as separate functions,
improving clarity, maintainability, and reusability.

6. Menu-Driven Interface<br>
